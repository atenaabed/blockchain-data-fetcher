# Blockchain Data Fetcher

This repository contains a collection of scripts that fetch blockchain data from multiple sources.  
I developed these scripts during internal company projects to retrieve different types of Web3 information across several platforms.

## 📌 Data Sources Used
The scripts connect to various blockchain explorers and API providers, including:

- **Etherscan**
- **BTC Scan**
- **Infura**
- **Coingecko**
- **OkLink**
- **GoPlus**
- **Moralis**
- **Coinbase APIs**

## 📊 What This Project Includes
The codeس in this repository demonstrate how to fetch:

- Transaction data  
- Token information  
- Chain/network data  
- Wallet details  
- General blockchain metadata from different APIs  

## 🔧 Technologies
- JavaScript / Node.js  
- Web3.js / Ethers.js  
- REST & RPC API calls  

## 🎯 Purpose
The goal of this repository is to show how I extract and aggregate blockchain-related data from multiple platforms for analysis and preparing necessary data for projects .
